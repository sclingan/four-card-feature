## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library


### What I learned

I learned a lot more about using Flexbox, responsive sites
are a lot easier with Flex.


### Continued development

I would like to return to this project and add more 
content when cards are clicked. Maybe use React router or 
something similar to move page to page.

### Useful resources

- (https://validator.w3.org/) - Always test your sites!!
- (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) - A great place to learn!!
